                <h2>1967</h2> <br> Founded in 1967 as the <i>Celestial Omnibus Coffee House</i>, coffeehouse began a bar and dining space in the basement of the Flowers Building on West Campus. The goal was to create as a low-pressure space where students could talk, think, and debate away from the usual Duke intensity.

Over the decades, coffeehouse has hosted intimate shows by artists who would later become major names, including Guided By Voices, Royal Trux, Yo La Tengo, The Ruins, Beck, and many more.</div>
